<h2 align="center">Netspeed Monitor</h2>
<p align="center">An app to monitor the netspeed</p>
<hr/>

### Motivation
I got this idea to create this app because I need something from which I can see the current netspeed. Due to pandemic, lots of people spending there time in system, so I thought why don't create an app which shows your current downloading and uploading speed in real time. 
### How to use
1. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vipinrana/netspeed-monitor/releases">release link</a> 
2. Download the netspeed-monitor.zip file and extract it.
3. Now click on the netspeed-monitor.exe file.

After you click, you will see the below application, as show below

Here, up arrow shows the uploading speed and down arrow shows the downloading speed.

After application appears, right click on the application window you will see the menu.

You can change the position of application based on your need.

You won't see the application in taskbar. It will appear as the tray icon. Like below(Highlighted by orange border)

To quit the app, right click on the app icon and click on close. As show below.

> <b>Note:</b> Currently this app is in open beta pre release. So there might be you face some unexpected error like delay in opening app, multiple instance of app. Currently I tested this app in window 10 and later. Features like auto update not added.
